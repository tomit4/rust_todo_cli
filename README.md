## BomberBot's Todo CLI in Rust

This simple repo contains a follow along to [BomberBot's Tutorial on Building a
CLI Todo App In Rust](https://bomberbot.com/rust/rust-programming-language-tutorial-building-a-command-line-to-do-app/).

Note that this code is refactored to be a bit more organized and follow some
better practices than the ones demonstrated in the tutorial, and is meant to be
scaffolded off for a more robust todo application.
